# Lead Score Case Study
 Lead Score Case Study: Analyzing and predicting lead conversion probabilities using machine learning techniques.
## Problem Statement 
 X Education is an education company that offers online courses for industry professionals. The company attracts many visitors to its website through various marketing channels. The company faces a problem: its lead conversion rate is very low. Out of 100 leads, only 30 become customers on average.
 To solve this problem, X Education wants to identify the most potential leads, also known as 'Hot Leads'. The company has hired you to help them with this task. Your job is to build a model that can assign a lead score to each lead based on various factors, such as their demographics, behavior, preferences, etc. The higher the lead score, the more likely the lead is to convert. The lower the lead score, the less likely the lead is to convert. The company's CEO has set a target of achieving an 80% lead conversion rate with this model.
## Goals and Objective
 Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.
 There are some more problems presented by the company which your model should be able to adjust to if the company's requirement changes in the future so you will need to handle these as well. These problems are provided in a separate doc file. Please fill it based on the logistic regression model you got in the first step. Also, make sure you include this in your final PPT where you'll make recommendations.
